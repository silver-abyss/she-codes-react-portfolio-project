      Hi, I'm Yuliia. I live in Ukraine. For the last six years I've worked as
      an English teacher. Throughout my career, I've noticed that I have always
      been good with teaching and communication with people. For example, when I
      was working at English courses, I needed to communicate and manage large
      groups of people with different age, interest and motivation. I tried to
      find an approach to everyone and this task was a success because my
      students performed good results with joyful mood in a friendly atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to develop professionally, study new technologies and approaches. I
      have great passion to study because I really love learning and every piece
      of new information is really useful and fascinating. I applied for
      SheCodes Foundation and now I have a great time learning HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. In my downtime I enjoy reading, cooking, running and playing
      video games but now I'm fully devoting myself to studying.
